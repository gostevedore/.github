Stevedore is a tool for building Docker images at scale, and it is not intended to replace Dockerfile or Buildkit. Instead, Stevedore can be used in conjunction with these tools to help streamline the process of building and promoting multiple Docker images.

One of the key benefits of using Stevedore is that it provides a consistent way to build Docker images and its descendant images, which can be helpful when dealing with large and complex projects that require multiple images. You can also create a more efficient and automated process for building and promoting Docker images.

Overall, Stevedore is a useful tool for anyone who needs to build and manage large numbers of Docker images, and it can help to improve the experience of building and promoting Docker images at scale.
